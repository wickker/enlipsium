With a film so thin, flexible and sensitive, we can now customize X-ray devices like never before.\n\nGiven that most of the things we try to image are never really flat - have you ever wondered why X-ray detectors are always flat?\n\nCan we reduce the X-ray dosage used in medical screening?\n\nMany believe that the current X-ray dosage is sufficiently low, but at Enlipsium, we say let's go lower.\n\nJoin us today in our march towards a mordern X-ray industry!",
